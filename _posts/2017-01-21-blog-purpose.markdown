Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.


**I'm going to blog.**  I have been mulling the idea of a blog for a while now.  But then I asked myself WHY, and couldn't really find a reason.  In the end, it was just something else in my life that would be pitting itself against the minutes I have left on earth.  Ultimately, I knew it would be a failure.  **Enter purpose...**

**So what is my purpose**.  I have recently found a new purpose, for me and my blog.  It's mostly self serving, but my hope is that it will also be helpful to others.  *I want to be better.*  *I want to have an impact.* For a long time I have been okay with the status quo - being satified with what I already knew, learning a little at a time as needed, but not with any particular aim, except to be able to do my job.  I'm changing that.  The target is a little wide at the moment, but I plan to narrow it's focus over time.  **The purpose is to learn and to blog on that learning.**  My hope is that blogging about what I'm learning will give me:

1. a reason to blog
2. facilitate better learning
3. help others who may eventually come accross the blog 

For the moment, it's more of a soliloquy.
